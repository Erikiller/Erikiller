## Hi Geeks,

My Name is Erik and I am a 16 years old C# .net Dev

As I am currently working on an unpublished project there is not much to show here; **but** I can tell you a little bit about the Project:
We (two other guys and I) are currently working on a voxel game and the game engine behind this game; this requires some good knowledge and skills with working in a team.

There will be some more projects in the near future but until then you have to wait ;)
